# Demonstrating ANSI Colors in Metadata

## ANSI Colors in Metadata

Although ANSI colors can't be rendered directly in metadata, here's how you might include ANSI color codes in metadata fields as plain text:

```plaintext
Title: \033[34m"Demo of ANSI Colors in Metadata"\033[0m
Format: \033[32m"html"\033[0m
Jupyter: \033[33m"python3"\033[0m
```
